- **Content Preservation**: Maintains line breaks and formatting
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: View all languages simultaneously
- **Dynamic Row Management**: Add/remove rows as needed

## 🛠 Translation Service Improvements

### Chunking Algorithm
The application now includes a sophisticated text chunking system that:
- Splits content by lines, sentences, and words as needed
- Maintains natural text boundaries
- Handles special characters and formatting
- Preserves content structure

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms minimum interval between requests
- **Error Classification**: Specific error messages for different failure types
- **Auto-retry**: Automatic retry for temporary failures
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation for service issues

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Languages processed in batches of 3
- **Request Queuing**: Prevents overwhelming the translation API
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids redundant translations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback for long operations

### URL Encoding & Limits
- **Enhanced Encoding**: Proper handling of special characters
- **Length Validation**: Conservative 8KB URL limits
- **Character Escaping**: Robust encoding for quotes, ampersands, etc.
- **Chunk Splitting**: Automatic splitting for oversized content

## 📊 Translation Statistics

The application now tracks and displays:
- **Success Rate**: Successful vs. failed translations
- **Real-time Progress**: Current translation status
- **Timing Information**: Last translation timestamp
- **Error Analytics**: Failure reasons and recovery status

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

### Social Media Management
- Translate posts for multiple markets simultaneously
- Maintain consistent messaging across languages
- Quick turnaround for time-sensitive content

### Marketing Campaigns
- Localize marketing copy efficiently
- Ensure brand consistency across regions
- Export translations for design teams

### Event Management
- Translate event descriptions and announcements
- Create multilingual promotional materials
- Coordinate international event communications

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Translation Service Architecture
```typescript
// Enhanced chunking with smart boundaries
function chunkText(text: string, maxLength: number = 1000): string[]

// Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
async function withRetry<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>, maxRetries: number = 3)

// Rate limiting to prevent API throttling
class RateLimiter {
  private minInterval = 100; // 100ms between requests
}
```

### Error Recovery Strategy
1. **Immediate Retry**: For temporary network issues
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive delays (1s, 2s, 4s)
3. **Error Classification**: Different strategies for different error types
4. **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and retry options

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time translation progress tracking
- Success/failure rate monitoring
- Automatic performance optimization
- User-friendly progress indicators

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chinmayjoshi18/TranslateX.git
cd TranslateX
