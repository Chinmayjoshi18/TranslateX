## 🧪 Technical Architecture

### OpenAI Integration Details

The translation system uses OpenAI's chat completion API with optimized settings:

1. **Model Configuration**
   ```typescript
   model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
   temperature: 0.3        // Balanced creativity/consistency
   max_tokens: 2000        // Sufficient for long translations
   top_p: 1               // Full vocabulary access
   ```

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - System prompt for professional translator role
   - Context-aware instructions for natural translation
   - Language-specific optimization

3. **Processing Features**
   ```
   Smart Chunking → Text split intelligently
